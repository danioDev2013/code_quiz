# JavaScript Quiz

## Description
---

A timed quiz, that asks the user a series of JavaScript questions fundamentals and at the end saves the scores with local storage. This was designed for anyone who is interested in JavaScript. I wanted to create this to help quiz myself, that way I am better prepared for interviews in the future. This quiz is user friendly and easy to use.

    Some of the concepts I learned from this:
    * setTimout
    * setInterval
    * JSON
    * localStorage, getItem, setItem
    * createElement
    * setAttribute
    * eventListner
    * preventDefault
    * removeChild

    I further understood:
    * functions
    * using styling in js
    * for loops
